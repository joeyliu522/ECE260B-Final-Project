**ERROR: (IMPOAX-820):	The OA features are disabled in the current session of Innovus because the oax shared library could not be loaded properly. This could be because your installation was not properly configured. To enable OA features, exit the current session and re-launch Innovus either after fixing your installation by running the Configure Installation phase, or after setting the OA_HOME variable to point to a proper OA installation. Check the "OpenAccess Installation and Configuration Guide" manual for more information.
